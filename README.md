Files: CIS41_Project <br>

Tasks:
1. EDA - pivot table, groupby table, ECDF, mixed PairGrid, barplot, striplot, FacetGrid, distplot, violinplot, joinplot, histplot, countplot, scatterplot, boxenplot, boxplot, swarmplot, pie chart, heatmap, relplot, regplot, pairplot, choropleth
2. Hypothesis Testing - Chi-squared, ANOVA, Z-Test
3. Conclusion (Q&A, findings) 

#### Conclusion (main take aways)
- Bathroom is mostly correlated with house price. Try to buy houses with more bathrooms, apparently it will have higher prices. For house flippers, it is good to find cheap houses with more bathrooms, then you can re-sell for more profit after flipping it.
- Most townhouses across US may be undervalued. Townhouses should worth more than condos because they dont have common walls and have independent units. Since Townhouses price is cheaper than Condos, for home buyers, Townhouses might have higher chance to get a bargain/ buyers may obtain more value.
- Correlation between "savings rate" and "$ per square feet" is positive. (may indicate more you save, more expensive per square feet you purchase)
- There is a negative correlation between Individual's Annual Income and Size of House (So the more you make the smaller place you live. Make less money so you live in a big house)
- (Great for target ad) Countryâ€™s savings rate is mostly 25-35%, since i know how much is in your wallet/savings, i can calculate what kind/price-range of items are appropriate for you to spend on.
- A chart of top ten cities with strong economies (descending order) plotted with savings rate and size.
